# Flask Real Time Chat App

Leveraging the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x) framework along side [socket.io](https://socket.io/) to create a real time chat application server using python.

<br />

### Pre-Installation

We will assume [python](https://www.python.org/) is pre installed as well as the package manager pip.

Installing on global vs an environment. It is suggested to install Flask and it's dependencies in an environment rather than in the global scope. 
##### *Using an environment can sidestep future complications when using different versions of packages

<br />

If you choose to initialize globally, skip to installation.
